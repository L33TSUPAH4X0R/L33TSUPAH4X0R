Hi,

I'm L33T, I am a computer engineer graduated from Ege University.

I'm working on Network Operation and Automatization System at Vodafone as PS Core Network Operation Engineer.
Scripting some Mobile Broadband Devices ( SGSN/MME, GGSN/EPG, PGW, SWG etc.)
On the other hand I'm very interested in Offansive Security, Blockchain Developing, AI/ML Bots for Games etc. 
It's empty for now, but it will surprise you in the future.
