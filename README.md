Hi I'm L33T SUPA H4X0R

If you're wondering what my nick means just google it.

I'm working on Network Operation and Automatization System at Vodafone as PS Core Network Operation Engineer.
Scripting some Mobile Broadband Devices ( SGSN/MME, GGSN/EPG, PGW, SWG etc.)
I also work extensively for CCNA.
On the other hand I'm very interested in Offansive Security.  I joined lots of Bootcamp ( İş Bankası, Akbank Gençlik Akademisi etc.) about that.

It's empty for now, but it will surprise you in the future.
